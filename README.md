# 🎵 Dummy Music Streaming Platform

A project loosely inspired by Spotify, built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is a conceptual clone with a custom UI and layout, created for learning and experimentation.

## 🎯 What This Website Actually Does

I built this with the thing in mind that while people code, there's a need for white music that keeps on playing in the background. This music streaming platform provides a continuous flow of royalty-free tracks perfect for coding sessions, studying, or just vibing while you work.

**Fun Fact:** This website is intentionally not responsive – because who codes on a phone? (Pun intended! 😄) It's designed for desktop (and laptop of course) developers who need their tunes while they craft beautiful code on proper screens.
